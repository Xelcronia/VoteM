# VoteM
This plugin displays a custom message to a player when he/she types "how to vote" or "where to vote"
There's also an option to display a message when a player types "vote", which is set to false at default for anti-spamming reasons.

# How to use
- Drop the plugin in your plugins folder, restart the server.
- Set you the messages in the config and you're set :)
